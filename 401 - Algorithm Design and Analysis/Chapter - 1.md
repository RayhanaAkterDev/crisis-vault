> **Asymptotic Notation** is a mathematical tool used to represent the time complexity of an algorithm during _asymptotic analysis_, which estimates the algorithm's efficiency independent of machine-specific factors like processor speed or disk I/O. It describes the running time in terms of a function `T(n)`, where `n` is the input size, and focuses on the growth of this function as `n` becomes large.

> Asymptotic notation is a mathematical method used to describe the running time or space complexity of an algorithm as the input size (n) grows large. Since actual execution time depends on factors like processor speed, instruction set, and disk I/O, we estimate an algorithmâ€™s efficiency using asymptotic analysis. The time complexity is represented by a function T(n), where n denotes the input size. Asymptotic notations help describe how T(n) behaves as n increases, allowing us to compare algorithm efficiency by focusing on dominant terms and ignoring constant factors.
