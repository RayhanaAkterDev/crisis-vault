> **Asymptotic Notation** is a mathematical tool used to describe an algorithm's running time during asymptotic analysis, which estimates its efficiency without considering machine-specific factors like processor speed or disk I/O. The time complexity is represented as a function `T(n)`, where `n` is the input size. Asymptotic notations help us understand how `T(n)` behaves as `n` increases, making it easier to compare algorithms by focusing on the most significant terms and ignoring constant or smaller factors.
