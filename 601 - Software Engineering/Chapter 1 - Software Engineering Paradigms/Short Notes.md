1. **SEI** #board_2017 
> The **Software Engineering Institute (SEI)** is a well-known research and development center in the field of software engineering. It was established in **1984** by the **U.S. Department of Defense** and is operated by **Carnegie Mellon University**, USA. The main purpose of SEI is to improve the **quality, security, and productivity** of software systems. It supports both **government and private organizations** by providing best practices, frameworks, and tools for effective software development and maintenance.
> One of SEI’s most important contributions is the **Capability Maturity Model (CMM)**. This model helps organizations evaluate the maturity of their software development processes and improve them step by step. SEI also focuses on areas such as:
> - Software process improvement
> - Cybersecurity
> - Software architecture
> - Measurement and analysis

2. **CMM** #board_2021 #board_2017 #short_note 
> The **Capability Maturity Model (CMM)** is a framework developed by the **Software Engineering Institute (SEI)** to assess and improve the **software development process** of an organization. CMM provides a structured path for organizations to move from immature, unorganized software processes to mature, disciplined, and well-defined processes. It helps in measuring the capability of software processes and guides organizations to improve quality, productivity, and efficiency. CMM defines **five maturity levels**, each representing a stage of process improvement:
> 1. **Level 1 – Initial**: Processes are unpredictable and poorly controlled.
> 2. **Level 2 – Repeatable**: Basic project management processes are established to track cost, schedule, and functionality.
> 3. **Level 3 – Defined**: Processes are documented, standardized, and integrated across the organization.
> 4. **Level 4 – Managed**: Processes are measured and controlled using data and metrics.
> 5. **Level 5 – Optimizing**: Focus is on continuous process improvement through innovation and feedback.
>
> By following the CMM, organizations can achieve better project control, higher software quality, and more predictable results in software development.

3. Software prototyping  #board_2022 #board_2021 #board_2020 #board_2018 
> Software prototyping is a development approach where a working model (or prototype) of the software is built early in the development process. This model is not a complete system but an initial version that represents important aspects of the final product, such as the user interface, system flow, or core features. The main purpose of prototyping is to help developers and stakeholders understand system requirements more clearly by visualizing the functionality and design before actual development begins.
> Prototyping allows for early feedback from users, which helps reduce misunderstandings, enhances user satisfaction, and minimizes costly changes during later stages of development. It also helps identify missing or unclear requirements, assess feasibility, and improve system usability.
> There are several types of software prototypes. Each type serves different purposes depending on the complexity of the project and the clarity of the client's requirements.
> 1. **Throwaway (Rapid) Prototype**: Quickly built to understand requirements; discarded after use.
> 2. **Evolutionary Prototype**: Gradually developed and refined based on user feedback until it becomes the final product.
> 3. **Incremental Prototype**: Built in parts (modules) that are integrated to form the complete system over time.
> 4. **Extreme Prototype**: Commonly used in web development; starts with a static mockup and evolves into a working system through backend integration.
> 
However, if not managed properly, prototyping can lead to **scope creep**, where too many changes and additions are made, delaying the final product. Despite this, prototyping is a valuable tool in modern software engineering, especially in agile and user-centered development methodologies.
