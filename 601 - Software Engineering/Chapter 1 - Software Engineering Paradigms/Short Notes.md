1. **SEI** #board_2017 
> The **Software Engineering Institute (SEI)** is a well-known research and development center in the field of software engineering. It was established in **1984** by the **U.S. Department of Defense** and is operated by **Carnegie Mellon University**, USA. The main purpose of SEI is to improve the **quality, security, and productivity** of software systems. It supports both **government and private organizations** by providing best practices, frameworks, and tools for effective software development and maintenance.
> One of SEI’s most important contributions is the **Capability Maturity Model (CMM)**. This model helps organizations evaluate the maturity of their software development processes and improve them step by step. SEI also focuses on areas such as:
> - Software process improvement
> - Cybersecurity
> - Software architecture
> - Measurement and analysis

2. **CMM** #board_2021 #board_2017 #short_note 
> The **Capability Maturity Model (CMM)** is a framework developed by the **Software Engineering Institute (SEI)** to assess and improve the **software development process** of an organization. CMM provides a structured path for organizations to move from immature, unorganized software processes to mature, disciplined, and well-defined processes. It helps in measuring the capability of software processes and guides organizations to improve quality, productivity, and efficiency. CMM defines **five maturity levels**, each representing a stage of process improvement:
> 1. **Level 1 – Initial**: Processes are unpredictable and poorly controlled.
> 2. **Level 2 – Repeatable**: Basic project management processes are established to track cost, schedule, and functionality.
> 3. **Level 3 – Defined**: Processes are documented, standardized, and integrated across the organization.
> 4. **Level 4 – Managed**: Processes are measured and controlled using data and metrics.
> 5. **Level 5 – Optimizing**: Focus is on continuous process improvement through innovation and feedback.
>
> By following the CMM, organizations can achieve better project control, higher software quality, and more predictable results in software development.
