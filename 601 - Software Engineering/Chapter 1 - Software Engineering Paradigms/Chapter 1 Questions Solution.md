# 1. What is software? #board_2019
**Software** is a collection of programs, data, and instructions that enable a computer to perform specific tasks. It acts as an intermediary *(মধ্যস্থতাকারী)* between the hardware and the user, allowing the hardware to execute various functions. Software can be divided into two main types:
 - **System Software**: Includes operating systems and utility programs that manage computer hardware and resources.    
 - **Application Software**: Includes programs that help users perform specific tasks, such as word processing or internet browsing.

#  2. What do you mean by software engineering? #board_2022 #board_2021 #board_2017 
**Software engineering** is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production from the early stages of system specification through to maintaining the system after it has gone into use. In this definition, there are two key phrases:
 1. **Engineering discipline**: Engineers make things work. They apply theories, methods, and tools where these are appropriate.
 2. **All aspects of software production**: Software engineering is not just concerned with the technical processes of software development but also with managing people, understanding user needs, and ensuring quality throughout the software lifecycle.

## Write down the IEEE definition of software engineering. #board_2020 #board_2018
The IEEE (*Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers*) definition of software engineering:
1. The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable *(পরিমাপযোগ্য)* approach to the development, operation and maintenance of software, that is, the application of engineering to software.
2. The study of the approaches as in the above statement.

#  3. State and explain some qualities that are used to access software. #board_2018 
**Some qualities that are used to access software:**
 - **Functional suitability**: A set of attributes that bear on the existence of a set of function and their specified properties. The functions are those that satisfy stated or implied needs.
 	- Suitability
 	- Accuracy
 	- Interoperability
 	- Compliance
 	- Security
 - **Reliability**: A set of attributes that bear on the capability of software to maintain its level of performance under stated condition for a stated period of time.
 	- Maturity
 	- Fault tolerance
 	- Recoverability
 - **Usability**: A set of attributes that bear on the effort needed for use, and on the individual assessment of such use by a stated or implies set of users.
 	- Understandability
 	- Learn ability 
 	- Operability
 - **Efficiency**: A set of attributes that bear on the relationship between the level of performance of the software and the amount of resources used under stated conditions
 	- Time behavior
 	- Resource behavior
