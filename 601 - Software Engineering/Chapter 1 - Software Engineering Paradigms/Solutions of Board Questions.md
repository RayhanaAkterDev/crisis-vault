 1. What is software? #board_2019
> **Software** is a collection of programs, data, and instructions that enable a computer to perform specific tasks. It acts as an intermediary *(মধ্যস্থতাকারী)* between the hardware and the user, allowing the hardware to execute various functions. Software can be divided into two main types:
>  - **System Software**: Includes operating systems and utility programs that manage computer hardware and resources.    
>  -  **Application Software**: Includes programs that help users perform specific tasks, such as word processing or internet browsing.

2. What do you mean by software engineering? #board_2022 #board_2021 #board_2017 
> **Software engineering** is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production from the early stages of system specification through to maintaining the system after it has gone into use. In this definition, there are two key phrases:
> 1. **Engineering discipline**: Engineers make things work. They apply theories, methods, and tools where these are appropriate.
> 2. **All aspects of software production**: Software engineering is not just concerned with the technical processes of software development but also with managing people, understanding user needs, and ensuring quality throughout the software lifecycle.

4. Explain the attributes of quality software. #board_2021 #board_2019  #board_2017 
	- Explain the attribute of a good software product. 
> **Attributes of a good software product**: There are 4 attributes of a good software –
> 1.  **Maintainability**: Software written in such a way so that it can evolve to meet the changing need of customers. This is a critical attribute because software change is an inevitable requirement of a changing business environment..
> 2. **Dependability**: A software must be trustworthy, reliable, safe, and secured. Use of the software should not be harmful to the customer in any way. Even at a system failure, a dependable software should not cause physical or economical damage. Also, malicious users should not be able to access or damage the system.
> 3. **Efficiency**: A software should be efficient in every way. The software should not make wasteful of system resources. Responsiveness should be there, and  the memory utilization should be minimum and also the process time is a consideration.
> 4. **Acceptability**: The software must be acceptable to the group of users for which it's designed for software should be understandable, reliable and compatible with other system they use.

5. List out the key challenges facing software engineering and discuss those. #board_2022 #board_2020  
	- Mention the key challenges facing four qualities that are used to access software. #board_2019 
> **Key challenges facing software engineering**:
> 1. **The heterogeneity challenge**: Increasingly, systems are required to operate as distributed systems across networks that include different types of computer and with different kinds of supports systems. The heterogeneity challenge is the challenge of developing techniques to build dependable software which is flexible enough to cope with this heterogeneity.
> 2. **Legacy System Integration**:They majority of software systems which are in use were developed many years ago yet they perform critical business functions. The legacy challenge is the challenge of maintaining and updating this software in such a way that excessive costs are avoided and essential business services continue to be delivered.
> 3.  **Adapting to Business and Social Change**: Software needs to evolve rapidly in response to changes in business goals, customer demands, technology trends, and social needs. The challenge lies in designing systems that are resilient, modular, and adaptable, enabling continuous updates and upgrades without causing disruptions.
> 4. **Security and Trust**: With the growing threat of cyber-attacks, ensuring that software is secure and trustworthy is a critical concern. This challenge involves developing methods for building secure systems, protecting user data, handling vulnerabilities proactively, and maintaining user confidence through privacy and integrity.
> 5. **Delivery Speed and Efficiency**: In today's fast-paced digital world, there is constant pressure to deliver high-quality software quickly. This challenge focuses on optimizing development processes through automation, agile practices, continuous integration/deployment, and minimizing time-to-market without sacrificing quality or stability.

6. Discuss about the professional and ethical responsibilities of a software engineering. #board_2021 
> **The professional and ethical responsibilities of a software engineering**:
> 1. **Confidentiality**: Engineers should normally respect the confidentiality of their employers or clients irrespective of whether or not a formal confidentiality agreement has been signed.
> 2. **Competence**: Engineers should not misrepresent their level of competence. They should not knowingly accept work which is out with their competence.
> 3. **Work Cooperatively in Teams**: Software development is often done in teams. Engineers should respect others in the team, communicate clearly, and help when needed. Good teamwork improves project quality.
> 4. **Ensure Software Quality**: Engineers must write clean, reliable, and secure code. They should test the software properly and make sure it works well and meets the client’s needs.
> 5. **Follow Legal Rules and Licenses**: Engineers should obey software laws like copyright rules, software licenses, and data protection laws. They must not copy code from others without giving credit or using proper licenses.
> 6. **Take Responsibility for Their Work**: A good engineer does not blame others for mistakes. They take full responsibility for the software they create and are ready to fix any issues caused by it.
> 7. **Use Skills for Good Purposes**: Software engineers should use their knowledge to help society. They can make useful applications that solve real problems and avoid working on harmful or illegal projects.
> 8. **Respect Intellectual Property**: Engineers should not steal others’ ideas or code. They must follow rules when using open-source software and give proper credit to original creators.
> 9. **Computer Misuse**: Software engineers should not use their technical skills to misuse  other people's computers. Computer misuse can range from small issues on a employer's machine/ computer to very serious problems.
