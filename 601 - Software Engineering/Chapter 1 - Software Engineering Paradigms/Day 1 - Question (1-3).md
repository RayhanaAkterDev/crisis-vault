#### 1. What is software? #board_2019
>[!note] Software definition:
>**Software** is a collection of programs, data, and instructions that enable a computer to perform specific tasks. It acts as an intermediary between the hardware and the user, allowing the hardware to execute various functions. Software can be divided into two main types:
> - **System Software**: Includes operating systems and utility programs that manage computer hardware and resources.    
> - **Application Software**: Includes programs designed to help users perform specific tasks, such as word processing or internet browsing.    
>
>Software is essential for the operation of computer systems and can be easily modified or updated to meet changing needs.

#### 2. What do you mean by software engineering? #board_2022 #board_2021 #board_2017 
- Write down the IEEE definition of software engineering. #board_2020 #board_2018

>[!note] Software engineering;
> Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production from the early stages of system specification through to maintaining the system after it has gone into use. In this definition, there are two key phrases:
> 1. **Engineering discipline**: Engineers make things work. They apply theories, methods, and tools where these are appropriate.
> 2. **All aspects of software production**: Software engineering are not just concerned with the technical processes of software development.

>[!note] The IEEE (*Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers*) definition of software engineering:
> 3. The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation and maintenance of software, that is, the application of engineering to software.
> 4. The study of the approaches as in the above statement.>
