# ðŸŒ¼ RAD software process mode

The **RAD (Rapid Application Development)** model is based on prototyping and iterative development with no specific planning involved. The process of writing the software itself involves the planning required for developing the product.

Rapid Application Development focuses on gathering customer requirements through workshops or focus groups, early testing of the prototypes by the customer using iterative concept, reuse of the existing prototypes (components), continuous integration and rapid delivery.

### ðŸ”„ **Phases of RAD Model**

1. **Business Modelling:**  
    Identifies and analyzes how information flows across business functions and defines what data is important, how itâ€™s used, and what drives successful operations.

2. **Data Modelling:**  
    Structures and organizes data collected during business modelling. Defines key data objects, their attributes, and the relationships between them.

3. **Process Modelling:**  
    Translates data models into workflows that achieve business objectives. Describes processes like adding, deleting, or updating data to fulfill business needs.

4. **Application Generation:**  
    Uses automation tools to convert process and data models into working prototypes. Actual coding is done at this stage with minimal manual effort.

5. **Testing and Turnover:**  
    Since components are tested during each iteration, overall testing time is reduced. Final testing ensures proper integration of all modules with full data flow and interface validation.
