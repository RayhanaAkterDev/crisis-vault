# ðŸŒ¼ RAD software process mode

Rapid Application Development (RAD) is a software process model that focuses on fast development and quick delivery of software. It is based on prototyping and iterative development, where different parts of the software are built and improved step by step. In RAD, there is no fixed planning phase â€”instead, planning happens as the software is being created.

User requirements are collected through workshops or focus groups, and early versions of the software (prototypes) are shown to users for feedback. Based on this feedback, changes are made quickly, and the product improves over time. RAD uses existing components when possible, which saves time and effort. Small teams work closely with users to make sure the final product meets their needs. This model works best when quick changes and strong user involvement are important.

### ðŸ”„ **Phases of RAD Model**

1. **Business Modelling:**  
    Identifies and analyzes how information flows across business functions and defines what data is important, how itâ€™s used, and what drives successful operations.

2. **Data Modelling:**  
    Structures and organizes data collected during business modelling. Defines key data objects, their attributes, and the relationships between them.

3. **Process Modelling:**  
    Translates data models into workflows that achieve business objectives. Describes processes like adding, deleting, or updating data to fulfill business needs.

4. **Application Generation:**  
    Uses automation tools to convert process and data models into working prototypes. Actual coding is done at this stage with minimal manual effort.

5. **Testing and Turnover:**  
    Since components are tested during each iteration, overall testing time is reduced. Final testing ensures proper integration of all modules with full data flow and interface validation.
