# ðŸŒ¼ Software Quality Assurance

**Software Quality Assurance (SQA)** is the process of ensuring that software meets the required quality standards throughout the *Software Development Life Cycle* (SDLC). It is an ongoing activity that regularly checks if the software is functioning correctly, follows rules and guidelines, and is free from major errors.
 
SQA includes activities like testing, code reviews, process improvement, and documentation to make sure the final product is reliable, efficient, and error-free.
