# ðŸŒ¼Different types of prototyping

Prototyping is a key approach in software development where early versions of a system or its components are built to understand requirements, test functionalities, and gather user feedback. Based on the purpose and nature of the project, different types of prototyping methods are used. These are discussed below:
 
1. **Throwaway Prototyping (Rapid Prototyping)**: In throwaway prototyping, a quick and temporary model of the software is built to understand unclear or incomplete requirements. This prototype is used mainly for demonstration and requirement gathering purposes. Once the feedback is collected, the prototype is discarded, and the final system is developed from scratch. It helps reduce misunderstandings early on, but the work done on the prototype is not reused in the final product.

2. **Evolutionary Prototyping**: In evolutionary prototyping, the prototype is not discarded but instead gradually refined based on user feedback. The system is built in a step-by-step manner, and new features are added or improved continuously until it becomes the final product. This approach is ideal for projects where requirements are expected to evolve over time. It ensures better alignment with user needs, but can become complex to manage as the system grows.

3. **Incremental Prototyping**: Incremental prototyping involves breaking the overall system into smaller modules and developing prototypes for each module independently. These module prototypes are then integrated to form the complete system. This approach allows developers to focus on one feature at a time and makes it easier to test and improve specific parts of the application. It is particularly useful for large-scale projects where different components can be developed in parallel.
   
4. **Extreme Prototyping**: Extreme prototyping is primarily used in web-based application development. This type of prototyping emphasizes rapid UI development and quick user feedback. It follows a structured three-phase approach to ensure that the user interface and interaction meet the desired requirements before full backend integration.

	1. **Phase 1: Static HTML Mockup**: The first phase involves creating a simple, static HTML mockup of the user interface. This mockup focuses purely on the visual aspects of the design and does not include any functionality or dynamic content.
	2. **Phase 2: Functional Prototype with Simulated Data**: The static mockup is converted into a functional prototype, where interactions are simulated, but no real data is processed. This gives users a preview of the app's behavior.
	3. **Phase 3: Backend Integration**: The prototype is integrated with a real backend, enabling live data processing and turning the prototype into a fully functional application for testing.
