### ‚úÖ **Merits of Spiral Model**

- **Best Model to Handle Risky Projects:** It focuses on identifying and managing risks early in each cycle.

- **Good Choice for Large Projects:** Suitable for complex systems that require careful planning and risk control.
    
- **Flexible with Requirements:** Supports evolving requirements through iterative development.
    
- **Better Customer Satisfaction:** Continuous customer involvement ensures the product meets user needs.
    
- **Iterative and Incremental Approach:** Allows gradual refinement of the system with each cycle.
    
- **Open to Receiving Any Feedback:** Feedback is incorporated at every iteration to improve the product.
    
- **Better Quality:** Early risk management and iterative testing enhance overall software quality.
    
- **Better Planning and Monitoring:** Each cycle begins with detailed planning, improving project control.
    
- **Systematic and Structured:** Combines formal phases with iterative flexibility for organized development.

### ‚ùå **Demerits of Spiral Model**

- **Complex and Costly**: The model can be expensive and difficult to manage for smaller projects due to its complexity.
- **Requires Expertise**: Effective risk analysis needs skilled and experienced professionals.
- **Not Suitable for Low-Risk or Small Projects**: The overhead of risk management may be unnecessary for simple or well-defined systems.
- **Time-Consuming**: Multiple iterations can lead to longer development timelines compared to linear models.
