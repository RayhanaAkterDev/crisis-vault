# 🌼Software Engineering Process 

The **software engineering process** is a structured approach to software development aimed at producing high-quality software. It involves a series of stages, each focused on a specific aspect of software creation.

1. **Project Planning and Feasibility Study**: This phase involves assessing the project's scope, cost, timeline, and resources. Feasibility studies are conducted to determine whether the project is technically, financially, and operationally viable.

2. **Requirement Analysis**: In this phase, the requirements of the software are gathered from stakeholders and analyzed to understand what the software must do.

3. **System Design**: Based on the requirements, the system's architecture and components are designed, including the user interface, database, and software modules.

4. **Implementation (Coding)**: The actual code for the system is written, following design specifications and coding standards.

5. **Testing**: After coding, the software undergoes various tests (unit, integration, system) to identify and fix defects and ensure it meets the requirements.

6. **Deployment**: The software is deployed to users, installed, and configured in the production environment.

7. **Maintenance**: After deployment, the software is maintained by fixing issues, improving performance, and updating features based on user feedback.
