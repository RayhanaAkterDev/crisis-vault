# Classification of Network according to Distance

**Computer network** fall into **three** classes regarding the size, distance, and the structure namely:

## ðŸ”¹LAN (Local Area Network)

A **LAN** is a network that connects computers and other devices within a **small area**, like a home, office, school, or university. It allows users to share data, files, software, printers, scanners, and internet. Devices in a LAN are connected through one or more **switches**, and they use **private IP addresses** as defined by the TCP/IP protocol. A **router** is usually used at the edge of the LAN to connect it to bigger networks like the internet or a WAN.

## ðŸ”¹ MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)

A **MAN** connects multiple LANs within a **city or large campus**, covering more area than a LAN but less than a WAN. It is used to connect offices, buildings, or institutions located in the same city. MANs are usually managed by one organization or internet service provider (ISP) and use **high-speed connections** like fiber optics. For example, MAN can connect all branches of a company across a city using **Metro Ethernet** or **fiber networks**. It also helps in linking LANs to the internet through a reliable backbone.

## ðŸ”¹ WAN (Wide Area Network)

A **WAN** is a network that covers a **large geographical area**, often across cities, states, or even countries. It connects multiple LANs and MANs using technologies like **routers, telephone lines, satellites, or leased lines**. The best example of a WAN is the **internet**. WANs are used to share data between computers located far apart and often require **high-speed and expensive equipment** to manage long-distance communication. They are commonly used by large organizations, governments, and ISPs.
