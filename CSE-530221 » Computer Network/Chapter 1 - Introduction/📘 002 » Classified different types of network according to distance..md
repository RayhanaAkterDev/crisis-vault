# Classification of Network according to Distance

**Computer network** fall into **three** classes regarding the size, distance, and the structure namely:

> **LAN (Local Area Network)**: A LAN connects computers and other network devices in a limited area, such as offices, schools, colleges, or universities, allowing them to share data, tools, and programs. These computers and devices are connected through a switch or a group of switches, using a private IP addressing system as defined by the TCP/IP protocol.
> 
> LAN makes it easy to share resources like printers, file servers, scanners, and internet access among users. A router is typically used at the edge of a LAN to connect it to a larger network, such as a Wide Area Network (WAN).  

> **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: A MAN is a network that connects multiple LANs within a  city or a large campus. It spans a larger area than a LAN but is smaller than a WAN. MANs are used to connect offices, buildings, or campuses in the same metropolitan region, allowing them to share resources and data efficiently. These networks are often managed by a single organization or service provider and use high-speed connections such as fiber optics.

  > **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: A WAN is a network that spans a large geographical area, often across cities, countries, or even continents. WAN connects multiple LANs and MANs using routers, public networks like telephone lines or satellites, and leased lines. The internet is the best example of a WAN. WANs are used to enable communication and data sharing between computers and devices located far apart.
  
The Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) generally expands throughout a city such as cable TV
network. It can be in the form of Ethernet. Tokenâ€¢ring, ATM, or Fiber Distributed Data Interface
(EDDI). Metro Ethernet is a service which is provided by ISPs. This service enables its users to expand
their Local Area Networks. For example, MAN can help an organization to connect all oi its offices
in a city. Backbone of MAN is high-capacity and high-speed fiber optics. MAN works in between Local Area Network and Wide Area Network MAN provides uplink for LANs to WANs or internet.

MAN or Metropolitan area Network covers a larger area than that of a LAN and smaller
area as compared to WAN. It connects two or more computers that are apart but resides
in the Ie ot different cities. It covers a large geographical area and may serve as an tsp
(Internet Seeice Provider). MAN is designed for customers who need a high-speed
connectivity. Speeds of MAN ranges in terms of Mbps. It's hard to design and maintain a
Metropolitan Area Network

As the name suggests the Wide Area Network (WANJ covers a wide area which may across
provinces and even a whole country. Generally. telecommunication networks are wide area network. these networks provide connectivity to mans and lans. since they are equipped with very high speed backbone, wans use very expensive network equipment.


WAN or Wide Area Network is a computer network that extends over a large
geographical area. although it might be confined within the bounds of a State or country.
A WAN could be a connection of LAN connecting to other LAN's via telephone lines
and racfio waves and may be limited to an enterprise (a corporation or an organization) or
accessible to the public. The technology is high speed and relatively expensive.
