# Computer Network & Distributed system

A **computer network** is a system where multiple computers or devices are interconnected through communication channels (such as cables, Wi-Fi, or optical fibers) to share data, hardware (like printers), and internet access. In a network, each computer operates **independently**, and communication is typically based on request-response without any central coordination for processing.

A **distributed system**, on the other hand, is a collection of independent computers that are connected via a network but work **collaboratively** to perform a single, unified task. These systems are designed to share computational power, storage, and processes in a coordinated manner. Although physically distributed, they appear as a **single coherent system** to the user, often providing higher fault tolerance, scalability, and performance.

## Differences between Computer Network & Distributed system

| **Aspect**   | **Computer Network**               | **Distributed System**                        |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose      | Communication and resource sharing | Coordinated task execution                    |
| Independence | Computers work independently       | Computers collaborate as one system           |
| User View    | Sees multiple separate systems     | Sees a single, unified system                 |
| Network Use  | Optional for task completion       | Essential for system operation                |
| Example      | Office LAN, Internet               | Google Search, Netflix, Online Banking System |
