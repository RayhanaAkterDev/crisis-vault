# Computer Network & Distributed system

A **computer network** is a system where multiple computers are connected to share resources and communicate with each other. Each computer in the network works **independently**.

A **distributed system**, on the other hand, is a system where multiple computers are connected and work **together as a single unit** to complete a common task. Although the components are physically separate, they appear as one system to the user.

## Differences between Computer Network & Distributed system

| **Aspect**   | **Computer Network**               | **Distributed System**                        |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose      | Communication and resource sharing | Coordinated task execution                    |
| Independence | Computers work independently       | Computers collaborate as one system           |
| User View    | Sees multiple separate systems     | Sees a single, unified system                 |
| Network Use  | Optional for task completion       | Essential for system operation                |
