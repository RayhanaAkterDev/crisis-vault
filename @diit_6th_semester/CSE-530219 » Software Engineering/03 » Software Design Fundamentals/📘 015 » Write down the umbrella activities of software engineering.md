# âœ¨Umbrella Activities of Software Engineering

Umbrella activities in software engineering support the main development processes and ensure that the project is completed successfully. These activities are ongoing throughout the software development lifecycle and help maintain project quality, control, and progress.
 
The activities of umbrella activities are discussed below:

1. **Software Project Tracking and Control**: This activity involves monitoring and managing the progress of the software project to ensure that it stays on schedule, within budget, and meets project goals. It includes tracking milestones, progress reports, and adjusting plans as needed.
 
2. **Risk Management**: Risk management focuses on identifying, analyzing, and mitigating potential risks that could affect the success of the software project. It helps prevent major issues and ensures that risks are proactively handled to minimize their impact.

3. **Software Quality Assurance (SQA)**: SQA involves activities to ensure that the software meets the required quality standards. This includes planning and conducting reviews, audits, inspections, and testing to verify that the software is reliable, secure, and performs as expected.

4. **Technical Reviews**: These reviews involve structured assessments of the software design, code, and other project artifacts. They are conducted by a team of professionals, helping to identify defects early, improve quality, and ensure that the software meets its requirements.

5. **Software Configuration Management**: Configuration management involves tracking and controlling changes in the software and its related documentation. This ensures proper version control, enables traceability of changes, and maintains consistency across different parts of the software.

6. **Document Preparation and Production**: Creating and maintaining thorough documentation is essential throughout the software development process. This includes documenting requirements, design decisions, code, and test results, ensuring that the software is maintainable and understandable in the future.

7. **Reusability Management**: Reusability management encourages the development of software components that can be reused across different projects or modules. This helps reduce development time and effort by leveraging existing, tested components.

8. **Measurement and Metrics**: This activity involves defining and collecting metrics related to software development. It helps track the quality of the software and the efficiency of the development process. Metrics such as defect density, code complexity, and test coverage are commonly used.

9. **Project Management**: Project management encompasses planning, organizing, and overseeing the execution of the software project. It ensures the project stays on track by managing resources, schedules, budgets, and stakeholder communication, facilitating the successful completion of the project.

10. **Verification and Validation (V&V)**: Verification and validation activities ensure that the software is developed according to specifications and fulfills user requirements. Verification checks if the software was built correctly (i.e., according to the design), while validation ensures the right product is built (i.e., meeting user needs and expectations).
