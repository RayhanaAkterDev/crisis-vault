# Requirement Engineering

**Requirements engineering** is a process of gathering and defining of what the services should be provided by the system. It provide the appropriate mechanism for understanding what the customer wants, analyzing need, assessing feasibility, specifying the solution unambiguously, validating the specification and managing the requirements as they are transformed into an operational system.

In practice, *requirements engineering isn't sequential process, it's an iterative process* in which activities are interleaved. 

The requirements engineering process is accomplished through the execution of seven distinct functions:
1. Requirements Elicitation
2. Requirements Analysis
3. Requirements Specification
4. Requirements Validation
5. Requirements Management

> **Requirements Engineering** is the process of identifying, analyzing, documenting, validating, and managing the needs and requirements of stakeholders for a software system.
