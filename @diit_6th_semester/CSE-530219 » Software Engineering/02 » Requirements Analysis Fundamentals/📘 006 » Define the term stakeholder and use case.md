# Stakeholder and Use Case

A **stakeholder** is any person, group, or organization that has an interest in the development, use, or outcome of a software system. This includes users, clients, developers, testers, project managers, and regulatory bodies â€” anyone who is affected by or can influence the system.

ðŸŸ¢ **Example:** A university student using the student portal, or an admin managing it, both are stakeholders.

A use case is a methodology used in system analysis to identify , clarify, and organize system requriements. 

In simple terms, a **use case** is a specific scenario that describes **how a user interacts with a system** to achieve a particular goal. It defines the steps or actions between a user (actor) and the system to complete a task.

ðŸŸ¢ **Example:** "Registering for a course" is a use case for a university management system.
