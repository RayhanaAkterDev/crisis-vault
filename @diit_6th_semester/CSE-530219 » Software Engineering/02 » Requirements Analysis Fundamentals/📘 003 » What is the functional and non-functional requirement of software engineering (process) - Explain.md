# The functional and non-functional requirement of software engineering

In software engineering, **requirements** are essential to define what a system should do and how it should behave. They are mainly divided into two types  —
1. Functional Requirements
2. Non-Functional Requirements

## Functional Requirements

**Functional requirements** define the specific behavior or *main functions* of a software system. They describe what the system should do, including all the features, operations, and interactions users can perform. More specifically, functional requirements describe the system’s functions, the expected inputs, how those inputs are processed, and the corresponding outputs. In some cases, they may also clearly state what the system should not do.

##### Common Functional Requirements in Software Engineering

- The user shall be able to log in with **valid credentials** and perform searches on either the entire **data set** or a **selected subset**.
- The system shall provide an **appropriate viewer** to read or display the uploaded documents.
- Each record in the database shall have a **unique identifier** to distinguish it from other records.

## Non-Functional Requirements

The non-functional requirements are the constraints on the functions provided by the system. They include timing constraints, constraints on the development process and standard. Non-functional requirements often apply to the system as a whole, they do not usually just apply to individual system features or services.

Non-functional requirements define the **quality attributes** of the system, i.e., **how the system should perform** rather than what it does. They set standards for system performance, usability, reliability, and other operational aspects. The constraints, like how many process the system can handle, what are the issues the system needs to take care of such as SQL injections, the rate of failure, what are the languages and tools will be used what are the rules you need to follow to ensure the system operates within the law of the organization.

Non-functional requirements are often critical than individual functional requirements. Users can usually find ways to work around a system function that doesn't really meet their needs, however, failing to meet a non-functional requirement can mean that the whole system is unusable.

**Examples:**
- The system should load within 3 seconds.    
- It should be available 24/7 with 99.9% uptime.    
- All user data must be stored securely and encrypted.    

Non-functional requirements are important for the **user experience and performance** of the system. They help in evaluating how well the system meets user expectations beyond just the core functionality.
