# The functional and non-functional requirement of software engineering

In software engineering, **requirements** are essential to define what a system should do and how it should behave. They are mainly divided into two types  â€”
1. Functional Requirements
2. Non-Functional Requirements

## Functional Requirements

Functional requirements define the **specific behavior** or **main functions** of the software system. They describe **what the system should do**, including all the features, operations, and interactions that users can perform. However, more specific functional system requirement describe the system functions, it's input, processing; how it's going to react to a particular input, and what's expected output.
