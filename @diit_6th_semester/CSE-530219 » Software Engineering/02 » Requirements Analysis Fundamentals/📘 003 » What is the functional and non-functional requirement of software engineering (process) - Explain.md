# The functional and non-functional requirement of software engineering

In software engineering, **requirements** are essential to define what a system should do and how it should behave. They are mainly divided into two types  —
1. Functional Requirements
2. Non-Functional Requirements

## Functional Requirements

**Functional requirements** define the specific behavior or *main functions* of a software system. They describe what the system should do, including all the features, operations, and interactions users can perform. More specifically, functional requirements describe the system’s functions, the expected inputs, how those inputs are processed, and the corresponding outputs. In some cases, they may also clearly state what the system should not do.
