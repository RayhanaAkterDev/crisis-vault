# Differences between functional and non-functional requirements

| **Aspect**        | **Functional Requirements**                       | **Non-Functional Requirements**                              |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Definition**    | Define ==what== the system should do.             | Define ==how== the system performs or behaves.               |
| **Focus**         | Specific features, functions, and behavior.       | Quality attributes like performance, usability, reliability. |
| **Scope**         | Apply to individual system functions or features. | Apply to the system as a whole.                              |
| **Example**       | User login, data search, report generation.       | System response time, availability, security.                |
| **Measurement**   | Usually binary (function works or not).           | Measured in levels (e.g., response time in seconds).         |
| **Importance**    | Necessary for system to operate correctly.        | Critical for user satisfaction and system usability.         |
| **Change Impact** | Changes may add or modify features.               | Changes affect overall system quality and constraints.       |
