The **Spiral Model** is a **risk-driven** software process model that combines features of both **iterative development** and the **Waterfall model**. It organizes the development process into a series of spiral-shaped loops or phases, each consisting of four main activities: planning, risk analysis, engineering, and evaluation.

Each loop represents one phase of the software development lifecycle and leads to a more refined version of the system. The key characteristic of this model is early identification and mitigation of risks through repeated refinement and feedback. It is best suited for large, complex, and high-risk projects where requirements may evolve over time.

## üìç Four Phases of Each Spiral Loop

Boehm‚Äôs **Spiral Model** is a **software development process model** proposed by **Barry Boehm in 1986**. It combines elements of both **design and prototyping** in stages, making it especially suitable for **large, complex, and high-risk projects**.

Each loop in the Spiral Model has **four main phases** (or quadrants):

**1. Planning Phase:**  
	In the planning phase, the main goal is to find out what the software should do. This includes gathering all the requirements from the client or user. The team identifies the objectives of the project and understands the system's needs and limitations. This phase also includes considering different ways to do the project and deciding which one is best. It sets the direction for the next steps.

**2. Risk Analysis Phase:**  
	This is the most important phase of the spiral model. Here, the team looks for possible problems or risks that might happen during the project. They study the different choices they have and check which ones are safe and effective. To reduce risks, they might create small prototypes to test ideas. The main purpose of this phase is to find and solve problems before they become serious.

**3. Engineering Phase:**  
	In this phase, the actual development work begins. The team starts designing the software and writing code based on the plan and user requirements. After the code is written, it is tested to check if it works correctly. This phase ensures that the system or part of the system is properly built and ready for review.

**4. Evaluation Phase:**  
	In the evaluation phase, the product or part of the product that has been built is shown to the customer for feedback. The team checks if the objectives of that phase have been met and whether the product meets user expectations. Based on the feedback, the team decides what to improve or add in the next loop of the spiral. This phase helps in continuous improvement of the software.

## ‚úÖ Merits of Spiral Model

- **Best Model to Handle Risky Projects:** It focuses on identifying and managing risks early in each cycle.
- **Good Choice for Large Projects:** Suitable for complex systems that require careful planning and risk control.
- **Flexible with Requirements:** Supports evolving requirements through iterative development.
- **Better Customer Satisfaction:** Continuous customer involvement ensures the product meets user needs.
- **Iterative and Incremental Approach:** Allows gradual refinement of the system with each cycle.
- **Open to Receiving Any Feedback:** Feedback is incorporated at every iteration to improve the product.
- **Better Quality:** Early risk management and iterative testing enhance overall software quality.
- **Better Planning and Monitoring:** Each cycle begins with detailed planning, improving project control.
- **Systematic and Structured:** Combines formal phases with iterative flexibility for organized development.

## ‚ùå Demerits of Spiral Model

- **Complex and Costly**: The model can be expensive and difficult to manage for smaller projects due to its complexity.
- **Requires Expertise**: Effective risk analysis needs skilled and experienced professionals.
- **Not Suitable for Low-Risk or Small Projects**: The overhead of risk management may be unnecessary for simple or well-defined systems.
- **Time-Consuming**: Multiple iterations can lead to longer development timelines compared to linear models.
