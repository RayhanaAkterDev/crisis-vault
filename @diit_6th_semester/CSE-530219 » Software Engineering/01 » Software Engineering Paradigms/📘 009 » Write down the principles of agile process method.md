# âœ¨The principles of agile process method 

> 1. **Early and Continuous Delivery**: The highest priority is to satisfy the customer through the early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

> 2.  **Welcoming Changing Requirements**: Even if requirements change late in development, Agile supports and accepts them to give the customer a better product.

> 3. **Frequent Delivery of Working Software**: Software is delivered in small parts frequently, usually in weeks, so that feedback can be taken early.

> 4. **Close Collaboration with Customers**: Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project to ensure customer's needs.

> 5. **Motivated Team**: Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

> 6. **Face-to-Face Communication**: The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

> 7. **Working Software**: Working software is the primary measure of progress, not just documents or plans.

> 8. **Sustainable Development**: Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

> 9. **Continuous Attention to Technical Excellence and Good Design**: Clean code and proper design help in maintaining software quality and ease of future changes.

> 10. **Simplicity**: Do only what is needed. Avoid adding extra features or unnecessary work.

> 11. **Self-Organizing Teams**: Teams should make their own decisions about how to complete their work for better efficiency and creativity.

> 12. **Regular Reflection for Improvement**: The team should regularly review their performance and find ways to become more effective.
