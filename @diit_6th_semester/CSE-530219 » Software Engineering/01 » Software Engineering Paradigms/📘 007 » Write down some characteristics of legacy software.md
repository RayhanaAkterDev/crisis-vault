**Legacy software** is old and outdated software that is still in use, even though newer and better versions may exist.

**Characteristics of legacy software**
 
1. **Old Technology**: Legacy software is built using outdated programming languages, tools, or platforms that are no longer widely used.

2. **Difficult to Maintain**: It is often hard to fix bugs or make changes because the code is complex, poorly documented, or the original developers are no longer available.

3. **Lack of Documentation**: Many legacy systems have little or no proper documentation, which makes understanding and updating the software challenging.

4. **High Maintenance Cost**: Maintaining legacy software can be expensive due to the need for specialized skills, compatibility issues, or the risk of system failure.

5. **Limited Compatibility**: Legacy software may not work well with modern systems, devices, or applications, making integration difficult.

6. **Critical to Business**: Despite being old, many legacy systems are still important for business operations and cannot be easily replaced.

7. **Poor Security**: Older systems often have weak or outdated security features, making them more vulnerable to cyberattacks.

 8. **Performance Issues**: Legacy software may run slowly or inefficiently compared to modern alternatives due to outdated design or hardware limitations.
