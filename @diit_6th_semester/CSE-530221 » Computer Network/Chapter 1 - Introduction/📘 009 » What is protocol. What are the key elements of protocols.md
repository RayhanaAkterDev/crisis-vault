# Definition of Protocol

A **protocol** is a formal set of rules and conventions that govern how data is transmitted, received, and interpreted between devices in a communication network. It defines the syntax, semantics, and timing of the communication to ensure that devices from different manufacturers can communicate effectively and reliably. Protocols specify how data is formatted, how errors are detected and corrected, and how connections are established and terminated.

Examples of common protocols include HTTP (for web communication), TCP/IP (for internet data transfer), and FTP (for file transfer).

## Key Elements of a Protocol #board_2018 

A **protocol** is a set of rules that governs the format, timing, sequencing, and error control of data communication in a network. The main elements that define a protocol are:

 > 1. **Syntax**: Syntax refers to the **structure or format of the data**. It defines how the bits and bytes are organized into fields within a message. For example, it specifies the order in which data is sent, headers, and delimiters.    

> 2. **Semantics**: Semantics deals with the **meaning of each section of bits**. It defines what specific patterns of bits represent, such as control signals, error messages, or data. It ensures that the receiving system correctly interprets the signals.    

> 3. **Timing**: Timing specifies **when data should be sent and how fast it should be sent**. It includes flow control, synchronization, and speed matching. Timing ensures that both sender and receiver are properly synchronized for successful communication.
