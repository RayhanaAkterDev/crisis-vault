## another alternative question:

###### Describe the function of different types of TCP or IP

The **TCP/IP model** uses different **protocols** to send, receive, and manage data across networks. Here are some of the main types:

### 1. **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**

- Ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data.    
- Establishes a connection before transferring data (connection-oriented).    
- Used for email (SMTP), web (HTTP), and file transfer (FTP).    

### 2. **IP (Internet Protocol)**

- Responsible for addressing and routing packets between devices.    
- Each device has an IP address used to identify it on a network.    
- Works with routers to send data to the right destination.

### 3. **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**

- Sends data quickly without checking for delivery (connectionless).    
- No error checking or acknowledgment â€“ faster but less reliable.    
- Used for video streaming, online games, and VoIP.    

### 4. **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**

- Sends control messages, such as error reports and status checks.    
- Used by tools like `ping` and `traceroute`.   

### 5. **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**

- Converts IP addresses to MAC addresses.    
- Helps find devices within the same local network.
