1. What is finite automata? #board_2021 #board_2020 
2. What is the utility of finite automata in respect of hardware and software? #board_2021 
3. Define NFA and DFA. #board_2018 
4. Design DFA's that accepts: #board_2021 
	1. Strings starting with $aba$
	2. Strings containing even number of $0's$ and even number of $1's$ 
5. Differentiate between NFA and DFA. #board_2022 #board_2021 
6. Convert to a DFA the following NFA: #board_2021 
	[Note: Figure provides on chapter 2 question no. 29]
7. Convert the following NFA to DFA. #board_2022 

|     | 0     | 1   |
| --- | ----- | --- |
| ➡️p | {p,q} | {p} |
| q   | {r}   | {r} |
| r   | {s}   | ∅   |
| *s  | {s}   | {s} |

3. Convert the following NFA to an equivalent DFA. Here 0 is starting and 10 is final state. #board_2021 [Note: An image is provided see exam-kit chapter-2 question no. 27]
4. Prove that if $D=\left(Q_{D},\sum,\delta_{D,}\left\lbrace q_0\right\rbrace,F_{D}\right)$ is the DFA constructed from NFA $N=\left(Q_{N},\sum,\delta_{N,}\left\lbrace q_0\right\rbrace,F_{N}\right)$ by the subset construction then $L(D) = L(N)$ #board_2021
