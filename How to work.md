- Use weekends or light days for bigger projects or reviews

I've restarted my coding journey from the beginning. I've a detail outline of learning topics. But I'm very confused how I do all these. I also had the idea of keeping my **LinkedIn profile active** — by posting what I learn every day — and doing the same with GitHub.

So the questions I’m stuck with are:
- How should I actually _learn_ each topic?    
- Should I create notes for every topic I cover?    
- How should I code
- Also, just so you know:  
    I’m using **Obsidian** for organizing everything — my daily routine, study notes, and this coding roadmap. It’s connected to GitHub.    

Should I:
- Keep my **practice code** inside Obsidian?    
- Or create a **separate GitHub repo** for each topic and project?
- Should I create a new gmail, a new linkedin id    

I’m really confused about all of this.  
And on top of that, if I try to do _everything_ at once, it will take up a lot of time — and I have university, studies, and other responsibilities too. Also can't take this slowly. I need to hurry up. I don't have much time, I need to a log of things. I need prepare myself for a job. so I have to make sure whatever I'm doing is not disorganized. 

I talked about all these previously with you. and you give some ideas. maybe they're or not I don't know. I'm just too confused about everything. I'm not liking any plans or suggestions.
