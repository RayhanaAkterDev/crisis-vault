### 1. How Should You Learn Each Topic?

*For each topic: Follow this simple loop (20% learning, 80% doing)*

1. **Understand the concept** (Watch a short video or read official docs/notes)    
2. **Write a short note in Obsidian** in your own words (2–5 bullet points)    
3. **Do a small practice** – solve 1–2 problems or build a mini version (button, card, function etc.)    
4. **Reflect + Post** on LinkedIn (1-paragraph + image/screenshot)    

📌 **Example**:

> “Today I learned about JavaScript functions. Functions help me organize logic into reusable blocks. I built a simple calculator function. Here's a snippet + what I understood 👇 [Image]”

---

### 2. Should You Create Notes for Every Topic?

Yes — but **keep them short and personal**.  
Think of it like: “Future me will be so confused — what 5 bullets do I wish I had?”

🧠 Format suggestion (for Obsidian note):

```pgsql
## Topic: JavaScript Functions

- Reusable block of code with input/output
- Declared using `function` or arrow syntax
- Can return values using `return`
- Scope matters (global/local)
- Example: `function add(a, b) { return a + b; }`
```

---

### 3. How Should You Code?

Split your code into 2 types:

1. **Practice snippets & quick experiments** → Inside Obsidian
	- Keep these local, organized with your notes
	- Use Markdown + Code blocks (for fast trial & error)    

2. **Projects & larger topic demos** → GitHub repo
	- 📁 Suggested GitHub Structure:
```cpp
	github.com/yourname
└── coding-journey/
    ├── html-css/
    ├── javascript-basics/
    ├── mini-projects/
    └── notes/  (optional, if you want them public)
```

```cpp
frontend-foundations/
├── html-css/
│   ├── html/
│   ├── css/
│   └── responsive-design/
│
├── tailwind-css/
│   ├── buttons.html
│   ├── cards.html
│   └── responsive-navbar.html
│
├── javascript-basics/
│   ├── fundamentals/
│   ├── dom/
│   └── practice-exercises/
│
├── git-github/
│   ├── git-commands.md
│   ├── github-workflow.md
│   └── branch-vs-merge.md
│
├── mini-projects/
│   ├── calculator/
│   ├── todo-app/
│   ├── color-picker/
│   └── responsive-landing-page/
│
└── README.md
```

📌 Don’t make a separate repo for every tiny topic. Group by theme.

### 4. What About LinkedIn and GitHub Posting?

- **Once a day** (or 3–4 times a week):  
    → Post a summary of what you learned + what you built    

✍️ Format example:
```less
📚 DAY 5 of #100DaysOfCode  
Today I learned about JavaScript conditionals.  
✅ Built a simple age checker  
💡 Key takeaway: `if`, `else if`, and `else` help control logic.  
📸 [screenshot of code or output]  
#JavaScript #CodingJourney
```
- **Push practice repos to GitHub** weekly or after each module

### 6. **How to Balance Everything and Still Go Fast?**

> ⚠️ You can’t go fast _and_ do everything _and_ stay sane.

But here’s how you can **go “fast enough” without losing focus**:
- **Weekdays**: 1 topic per day (note + mini-code + post)    
- **Weekends**: Practice + review + push code + bigger project    
- **Keep Obsidian light**: Don’t overthink formatting — just organize by folders/dates    
- **Batch social posting**: If you’re tired, post 3–4 updates in one go every few days

---

## ✨ ONE-SENTENCE RULE TO STICK TO:

> *“If I can learn it, build something small, and explain it simply — I’m making progress.”*

That’s the only thing that matters right now.
