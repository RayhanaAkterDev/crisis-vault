# Topic: Documentation Comments in Code

## What are Documentation Comments?

- Special comments that explain the purpose, usage, and behavior of code    
- Help readers (including future you) understand code quickly without reading all implementation details  
- Improve maintainability and collaboration    

## Why Use Documentation Comments?

- Provides context about what the code/file/function does    
- Helps debugging and future updates easier    
- Shows professionalism in coding projects    
- Essential for team projects and open-source contributions    

## Key Elements to Include

1. **Purpose**: What does this code/file/function do?    
2. **Inputs/Parameters** (if any): What data does it take?    
3. **Outputs/Return values** (if any): What does it produce?    
4. **Instructions** (if needed): How to use/run the code    
5. **Author & Date**: Useful for tracking versions and ownership    

## Common Formats

- Block comments at the top of files or functions    
- Inline comments for complex or non-obvious code sections    
- Language-specific styles (e.g., `/** ... */` for JS, `<!-- ... -->` for HTML)    

## Best Practices

- Keep documentation clear, concise, and up-to-date    
- Avoid stating the obvious; focus on “why” and “what” not “how”    
- Use templates for consistency    
- For tiny snippets, minimal comments are fine    

## What NOT to Do (Don'ts)

- **Don’t over-document:** Avoid writing huge paragraphs that no one will read    
- **Don’t document obvious code:** For example, don’t write `// increments i by 1` next to `i++`    
- **Don’t leave outdated comments:** Update or remove comments if code changes    
- **Don’t clutter code with too many inline comments:** Use them only when necessary    
- **Don’t skip documentation for bigger files/projects:** It’s more important as complexity grows    

## Example Documentation Comment (HTML)

```html
<!--    
	File: basic-structure.html     
	Purpose: Demonstrates the basic HTML5 document structure including doctype, head, and body.     
	Concepts covered: Document type declaration, metadata tags, semantic HTML tags.     
	Instructions: Open this file in a browser to view a simple webpage.

## How to Incorporate in Your Learning Workflow

- Add a documentation comment header to each practice file in GitHub    
- Use inline comments to clarify tricky parts    
- Keep Obsidian notes focused on concepts and short examples, not heavy code docs    
- Reflect on your documentation in LinkedIn posts as part of sharing your learning
