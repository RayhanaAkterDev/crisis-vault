🌐 **HTML Fundamentals: My First Frontend Milestone!**

As part of my frontend journey, I’ve completed the full core of HTML. This phase helped me understand how websites are structured and how content is presented meaningfully and accessibly.

✅ Topics I’ve covered:

- Basic HTML document structure (`<!DOCTYPE>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)    
- Text formatting using headings, paragraphs, span    
- Lists and links (unordered, ordered, anchor tags)    
- Media elements: images, audio, video, iframe    
- HTML tables for displaying structured data    
- Forms and advanced form elements with validation    
- Semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, etc.    
- Block vs inline elements    
- Accessibility basics (alt text, labels, ARIA)    
- HTML entities like `&lt;`, `&copy;`, and more    

🧠 For each topic, I:

- Took notes in Obsidian in my own words    
- Practiced by building small demos and components    
- Organized everything in my GitHub repo
