ðŸ‘‹ **Hello LinkedIn! I'm officially starting my Web Development Journey!** ðŸš€

Iâ€™m Rayhana Akter Sumaya â€” a CSE student with a strong passion for building beautiful, accessible websites. Iâ€™ve just completed the **HTML Fundamentals** phase of my learning, and I wanted to mark this milestone by sharing my progress publicly.

ðŸ“š So far, Iâ€™ve learned to:

- Structure web pages using clean, semantic HTML    
- Work with text, lists, links, images, and media    
- Build forms with validation and accessibility    
- Understand block vs inline elements and HTML entities

ðŸ”§ Behind the scenes:

- Iâ€™ve kept organized notes in Obsidian    
- Practiced each topic with mini projects    
- Documented everything in a GitHub repo    

ðŸŽ¯ **Next Step**: CSS Foundations â€” layouts, styling, and responsiveness!

This is just the beginning. Iâ€™m here to **learn, grow, and connect** with the tech community. If you're also learning frontend, feel free to connect â€” letâ€™s grow together! ðŸ’¬
